## Inclusion-Exclusion Rule

Let $A$ and $B$ be events. Then,

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B).
$$
 
## Mutual Exclusivity

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive (pairwise disjoint)** if, and only if,

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are pairwise disjoint, then the [inclusion-exclusion rule] simplifies to

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B).
