## Surds

A surd is an expression of the form $a + \sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b \ge 0$ are rational numbers.

### Rationalising the Denominator

Suppose that we have a fraction $\frac{y}{a + \sqrt{b}}$, where the denominator contains a surd. *Rationalising the denominator* essentially means removing the surd from the denominator. We can achieve this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $a - \sqrt{b}$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{y}{a + \sqrt{b}} 
&= \frac{y(a - \sqrt{b})}{(a + \sqrt{b})(a - \sqrt{b})} \\
&= \frac{y(a - \sqrt{b})}{a^{2} - b}.
\end{align*}

Since $a$ and $b$ are rational (from the definition of a surd), so will the denominator $a^{2} - b$.
