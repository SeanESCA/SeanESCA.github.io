# Transformations

## Applying Transformations to Functions

There are three possible types of transformations you can be asked to apply to a function: translations, reflections, and stretches. Given the curve $y = f(x)$,

-   a translation by the vector $\begin{pmatrix}a \\ b\end{pmatrix}$ gives the curve $y = f(x - a) + b$.

-   a reflection in the *x-axis* gives $y = -f(x)$.

-   a reflection in the *y-axis* gives $y = f(-x)$.

-   a stretch by a scale factor of $c$ in the direction of *y-axis* gives $y = a \cdot f(x)$.

-   a stretch by a scale factor of $c$ in the direction of *x-axis* gives $y = f \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)$.

You may find it helpful to visualise the curve $y = f(x)$ before and after each transformation, for which [Desmos's graphing calculator (opens in new tab)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator){target="_blank"} can be helpful.
