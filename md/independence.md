## Independence 

### Independence of Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if, and only if,

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B).
$$

### Independence of Discrete Random Variables

Let $X$ and $Y$ be discrete random variables. Then, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if, and only if, for all possible $x$ and $y$,

$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y) = \mathbb{P}(X = x)\mathbb{P}(Y = y).
$$
